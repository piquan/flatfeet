FLAT FEET WALKTHRU (COMMANDS ONLY)

This walkthru is provided to assist players who may be stuck.  You may
want to try using InvisiHints, the in-game HINT function, before using
this walkthru.  This is because InvisiHints is designed to avoid
spoilers, whereas this walkthru can easily spoil part of your game.
The puzzles are presented in a self-contained manner.  In other words,
only one puzzle is being addressed at a time, even though it means
some backtracking is necessary.

This walkthru shows all of the puzzles in the game, and their
solutions.  Red herrings aren't shown (other than where they occur in
room descriptions etc), and there has been no particular effort to
show clues leading up to solutions, optional dialog, etc.  In other
words, this walkthru can be useful for winning a game, but is neither
the fastest nor most complete way to finish the game.  NOTE: The last
part of the game includes a move that depends on one of the items in
the game, which is randomly generated.  A note is in the walkthru at
the appropriate point.

This walkthru contains only the user commands.  A version of this
walkthru with both user commands and game responses is available as
walkthru.txt.

This walkthru is Copyright (C) 2005 by Joel Ray Holveck.  It is part
of the Flat Feet game, and is provided on the same copyright terms as
the game itself.
