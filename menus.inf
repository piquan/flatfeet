	    "^Flat Feet is a comedy and a mystery, written by Joel Ray
 	    Holveck. It is my first released Interactive Fiction
 	    game, and was entered in the 2005 Spring Thing.^^
	    It is possible to get into an unwinnable state, but this
 	    will not happen without warning. You can always type
 	    WINNING to see if you can still win the game.^^
	    Flat Feet draws inspiration from many sources, but most
	    notably LucasArts's ~Sam & Max Hit The Road~ and the ~Sam
	    & Max~ comics. I've tried to keep Flat Feet original enough
	    to be entertaining (not to mention legal).^^
	    The geography is based on the San Francisco Bay Area, but
	    takes plenty of liberties for narrative purposes. The game
	    uses the Bay Area because it's convenient, not because I'm
	    writing a game specifically for Bay Area
	    residents. Consequently, it should be equally enjoyable to
	    anybody.^^
	    Bug reports, comments, praise, problems, all go to
            <joelh@@64piquan.org>.";

Option	-> -> "About InvisiHints"
 with	description "The InvisiHints provide everything you need to
    crack the toughest puzzles this game has to offer. Hopefully,
    they'll give you just the right amount of nudge that you need to
    solve the puzzle, without giving it away
    unnecessarily. Furthermore, I don't want the questions themselves
    to give too much away. If every InvisiHint question were pertinent
    to the game, the questions themselves would give far too much
    away. To counteract this, there's some random nonsense questions
    (i.e. questions that have nothing to do with the game). Therefore,
    do not use the presence or absence of a question on a certain
    topic as an indication of what is important.^^
    Each question provides several clues. These are given to you one
    at a time, in order. The first few clues in a question are
    usually quite vague, sometimes simple restatements of the
    problem. The last clues get quite specific, and (in some
    instances) give you specific commands to type. After each new
    clue, then you may want to work on the puzzle some more. The clues
    will still be here, right where you left them.^^
    Finally, a word of warning. The answers to all of the major
    problems in the game can be found in the InvisiHints. However, if
    you want to solve the problems yourself and do not want the game
    spoiled then do not read the hints.";

    "This game, and all accompanying materials, are Copyright (C) 2005
    Joel Ray Holveck.
    ^
    ^Before I get into all the legal details, let me start by saying
    this: you may use this game, on your own computer, without
    distributing it, however you want. You may copy this game, exactly
    as it is (including all the accompanying materials) for
    non-commercial use. That covers 99% of the reason that you may be
    looking here. The remainder of this document is to discuss the
    other 1%: modification.
    ^
    ^This game, and all accompanying materials, have two
    aspects. First, they function as a work of literature. Second,
    they function as useful (ie, non-literary) programming code. I
    want everybody to be free to use and distribute both aspects of
    the game, but the question of modification is a sticky one. I do
    not want the literature corrupted, but I don't mind if somebody
    uses the useful code in their own projects.
    ^
    ^Unfortunately, there isn't a clear way for me to separate these
    two aspects for the purposes of copyright law. For that reason,
    the license I distribute this game under only allows complete,
    exact copies, but I encourage people to contact me if they want to
    use functional code in their own games.
    ^
    ^What if I die, or am otherwise unable to be contacted? I don't
    want to keep people from being able to use my code. For that
    reason, if I fall off the face of the Earth, then this game
    can be licensed another way that lets them use any part they want
    (but under somewhat more restrictive terms).
    ^
    ^What follows is my own attempt to make this happen. If anybody
    has worked on this problem and has a better idea, please contact
    me and let me know.";

    ^This Creative Commons license grant is perpetual: you can use it

    ^THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS
    CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC LICENSE (~CCPL~ OR ~LICENSE~). THE WORK IS
    PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE LAW. ANY USE OF THE
    WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW
    IS PROHIBITED.
    ^
    ^BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT
    AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. THE LICENSOR
    GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR
    ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
    ^
    ^1. Definitions 
    ^a. ~Collective Work~ means a work, such as a periodical issue,
    anthology or encyclopedia, in which the Work in its entirety in
    unmodified form, along with a number of other contributions,
    constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are
    assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a
    Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work (as
    defined below) for the purposes of this License.
    ^b. ~Derivative Work~ means a work based upon the Work or upon
    the Work and other pre-existing works, such as a translation,
    musical arrangement, dramatization, fictionalization, motion
    picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment,
    condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast,
    transformed, or adapted, except that a work that constitutes a
    Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative Work for the
    purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the
    Work is a musical composition or sound recording, the
    synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
    (~synching~) will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose
    of this License.
    ^c. ~Licensor~ means the individual or entity that offers the Work
    under the terms of this License.
    ^d. ~Original Author~ means the individual or entity who created
    the Work.
    ^e. ~Work~ means the copyrightable work of authorship offered
    under the terms of this License.
    ^f. ~You~ means an individual or entity exercising rights under
    this License who has not previously violated the terms of this
    License with respect to the Work, or who has received express
    permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License
    despite a previous violation.
    ^
    ^2. Fair Use Rights. Nothing in this license is intended to
    reduce, limit, or restrict any rights arising from fair use, first
    sale or other limitations on the exclusive rights of the copyright
    owner under copyright law or other applicable laws.
    ^
    ^3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this
    License, Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,
    non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the applicable
    copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated
    below:
    ^a. to reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or
    more Collective Works, and to reproduce the Work as incorporated
    in the Collective Works;
    ^b. to distribute copies or phonorecords of, display publicly,
    perform publicly, and perform publicly by means of a digital audio
    transmission the Work including as incorporated in Collective
    Works;
    ^";
    print "
    ^The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats
    whether now known or hereafter devised. The above rights include
    the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary
    to exercise the rights in other media and formats, but otherwise
    you have no rights to make Derivative Works. All rights not
    expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved, including but
    not limited to the rights set forth in Sections 4(d) and 4(e).
    ^
    ^4. Restrictions.The license granted in Section 3 above is
    expressly made subject to and limited by the following
    restrictions:
    ^a. You may distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
    publicly digitally perform the Work only under the terms of this
    License, and You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource
    Identifier for, this License with every copy or phonorecord of the
    Work You distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
    publicly digitally perform. You may not offer or impose any terms
    on the Work that alter or restrict the terms of this License or
    the recipients' exercise of the rights granted hereunder. You may
    not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that
    refer to this License and to the disclaimer of warranties. You may
    not distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or publicly
    digitally perform the Work with any technological measures that
    control access or use of the Work in a manner inconsistent with
    the terms of this License Agreement. The above applies to the Work
    as incorporated in a Collective Work, but this does not require
    the Collective Work apart from the Work itself to be made subject
    to the terms of this License. If You create a Collective Work,
    upon notice from any Licensor You must, to the extent practicable,
    remove from the Collective Work any reference to such Licensor or
    the Original Author, as requested.
    ^b. You may not exercise any of the rights granted to You in
    Section 3 above in any manner that is primarily intended for or
    directed toward commercial advantage or private monetary
    compensation. The exchange of the Work for other copyrighted works
    by means of digital file-sharing or otherwise shall not be
    considered to be intended for or directed toward commercial
    advantage or private monetary compensation, provided there is no
    payment of any monetary compensation in connection with the
    exchange of copyrighted works.
    ^c. If you distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, or
    publicly digitally perform the Work, You must keep intact all
    copyright notices for the Work and give the Original Author credit
    reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing by conveying
    the name (or pseudonym if applicable) of the Original Author if
    supplied; the title of the Work if supplied; and to the extent
    reasonably practicable, the Uniform Resource Identifier, if any,
    that Licensor specifies to be associated with the Work, unless
    such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing
    information for the Work. Such credit may be implemented in any
    reasonable manner; provided, however, that in the case of a
    Collective Work, at a minimum such credit will appear where any
    other comparable authorship credit appears and in a manner at
    least as prominent as such other comparable authorship credit.";

    ^d. 
    ^For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical
    composition:
    ^i. Performance Royalties Under Blanket Licenses. Licensor
    reserves the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or
    via a performance rights society (e.g. ASCAP, BMI, SESAC),
    royalties for the public performance or public digital performance
    (e.g. webcast) of the Work if that performance is primarily
    intended for or directed toward commercial advantage or private
    monetary compensation.
    ^ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor reserves
    the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
    music rights agency or designated agent (e.g. Harry Fox Agency),
    royalties for any phonorecord You create from the Work (~cover
    version~) and distribute, subject to the compulsory license
    created by 17 USC Section 115 of the US Copyright Act (or the
    equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your distribution of such
    cover version is primarily intended for or directed toward
    commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.
    ^e. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance
    of doubt, where the Work is a sound recording, Licensor reserves
    the exclusive right to collect, whether individually or via a
    performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the
    public digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to
    the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 114 of the US
    Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions), if Your
    public digital performance is primarily intended for or directed
    toward commercial advantage or private monetary compensation.
    ^
    ^5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
    ^
    ^UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING,
    LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK AS-IS AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR
    WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS, IMPLIED,
    STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES
    OF TITLE, MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE,
    NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,
    ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
    DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF
    IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
    ^
    ^6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY
    APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY
    LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE
    OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE
    WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
    DAMAGES.
    ^
    ^7. Termination 
    ^a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
    automatically upon any breach by You of the terms of this
    License. Individuals or entities who have received Collective
    Works from You under this License, however, will not have their
    licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain
    in full compliance with those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7,
    and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
    ^b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted
    here is perpetual (for the duration of the applicable copyright in
    the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor reserves the right
    to release the Work under different license terms or to stop
    distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such
    election will not serve to withdraw this License (or any other
    license that has been, or is required to be, granted under the
    terms of this License), and this License will continue in full
    force and effect unless terminated as stated above.
    ^";
	    print "
    ^8. Miscellaneous 
    ^a. Each time You distribute or publicly digitally perform the
    Work or a Collective Work, the Licensor offers to the recipient a
    license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the
    license granted to You under this License.
    ^b. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable
    under applicable law, it shall not affect the validity or
    enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this License, and
    without further action by the parties to this agreement, such
    provision shall be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to
    make such provision valid and enforceable.
    ^c. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived
    and no breach consented to unless such waiver or consent shall be
    in writing and signed by the party to be charged with such waiver
    or consent.
    ^d. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the
    parties with respect to the Work licensed here. There are no
    understandings, agreements or representations with respect to the
    Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any
    additional provisions that may appear in any communication from
    You. This License may not be modified without the mutual written
    agreement of the Licensor and You.

    ^Creative Commons is not a party to this License, and makes no

    will not be liable to You or any party on any legal theory for any

^GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
^Version 2, June 1991
^
^Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
^59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
^Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
^
^Preamble
^
^The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.
^
^When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it
in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.
^
^To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.
^
^For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.
^
^We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.
^
^Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.
^
^Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.
^
^The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
    modification follow.";

^GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
^TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
^
^0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains
a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
under the terms of this General Public License.  The ~Program~, below,
refers to any such program or work, and a ~work based on the Program~
means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:
that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,
either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another
language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in
the term ~modification~.)  Each licensee is addressed as ~you~.
^
^Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the
Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).
Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.
^
^1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;
and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License
along with the Program.
^
^You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and
you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
^
^2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
^
^a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
^
^b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in
    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any
    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third
    parties under the terms of this License.
^
^c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an
    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a
    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide
    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under
    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this
    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but
    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on
    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)";
print "^
^These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
^
^Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Program.
^
^In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.
^
^3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:
^
^a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections
    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,
^
^b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium
    customarily used for software interchange; or,
^
^c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
    received the program in object code or executable form with such
    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)
^
^The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source
code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any
associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to
control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary
form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the
operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.
^
^If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.";
print "^
^
  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such
parties remain in full compliance.
^
^5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the
Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.
^
^6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to
these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to
this License.
^
^7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.
^
^If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under
any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to
apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other
circumstances.
^
^It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
^
^This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.";
print "^
^8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Program under this License
may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding
those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among
countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates
the limitation as if written in the body of this License.
^
^9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.
^
^Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and ~any
later version~, you have the option of following the terms and conditions
either of that version or of any later version published by the Free
Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of
this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software
Foundation.
^
^10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author
to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free
Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals
of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and
of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
^
^NO WARRANTY
^
^11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM ~AS IS~ WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED
OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS
TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
^
^12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED
TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

print "^
^How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
^
^If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.
^
^To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the ~copyright~ line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
^
^<one line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
^Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
^
^This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify
    it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by
    the Free Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or
    (at your option) any later version.
^
^This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
    GNU General Public License for more details.
^
^You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
    along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
^
^
^Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
^
^If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:
^
^Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year  name of author
^Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'.
    This is free software, and you are welcome to redistribute it
    under certain conditions; type `show c' for details.
^
^The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may
be called something other than `show w' and `show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.
^
^You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a ~copyright disclaimer~ for the program, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
^
^Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
  `Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.
^
^<signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1989
^Ty Coon, President of Vice
^
^This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General
Public License instead of this License.";
