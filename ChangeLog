	(laser): New object.

	(curator): Add ralph_thinks.

	(calling_card): Add ralph_thinks and curator_thinks

	* SF_CliffHouse.inf (cliff_house):
	When the hostess speaks in the movement handlers, turn

	(which isn't automatically reset).

	(ralph): Add some variety to the TELL RALPH ABOUT ... responses.

	* Peninsula.inf (meadow): Remove debugging print

	* PaloAlto.inf (palo_alto): Note the direction of Benny's.

	(benny): Allow 'caller' to be a valid query. Also, reorder the Give
	order handler for clarity.

	(case_note): Add 'slip of paper' as synonyms

	Improve the attack system, to let Ralph actually attack some
	people even if they define an ##Attack life routine.  This is
	controlled by can_attack.

	(ralph): Make Insert and PutOn now do their own things, instead of
	just throwing Ralph around.  I fear this will be the cause of many new
	bugs.

	(ralph): Do a little more work with the success/failure and
	notheld_mode for ThrowAt's automatic Take.

	* menus.inf: Compile fix

	Change RECEPTIONIST to HOSTESS

	* sky.inf: Do something reasonable with dropped objects

	* car.inf (car): Fix the code to determine if the player is going to a
	street.  It looks like the old code only worked by coincidence, but
	suddenly broke.  From what I can tell, the object numbers happened to
	coincide with the property numbers.  That's no longer true, probably
	from the CvsId addition.

	* Sunnyvale.inf (drunks): Add can_attack (for some of Ralph's new code)

	* Flibnaub.inf (MAX_PROP_TABLE_SIZE, MAX_OBJECTS): Increase

	(Street): Fix the code to determine if the player is going to a
	street.  It looks like the old code only worked by coincidence, but
	suddenly broke.  From what I can tell, the object numbers happened to
	coincide with the property numbers.  That's no longer true, probably
	from the CvsId addition.

	* menus.inf: Add CvsId

	Print the CVS ids in the About menu in debugging mode

	Lots of hint fixups, including a new Alcatraz section

	the objects are in the help system.  These are needed regardless of
	Z-Machine version.

	description.  This should probably be handled with a ralph_react
	instead.

	* SF_financial.inf (Elevator):
	Alter the each_turn dialog handler so it doesn't emit
	spurious lines.

	usually tell the user to do something else.

	* SF_GGP.inf (calling_card, curator): Only set the calling card's place
	when the player acquires it.  In this manner, we can make the calling
	card mandatory.  Conceptually, if the player goes to Sausalito before
	getting the card, then in that game, Carla doesn't work in Sausalito.
	(Think of her as Schrodinger's Cat: if the player gets the card, she
	works in Sausalito; if not, then she works in, say, Oakland.)
	* Flibnaub.inf (Initialize): Don't initialize the place here.

	* SantaCruz.inf (Mystery_Room, Mystery_Spot):

	Mystery_Spot.  Also improve the flight stuff.  I'm still not sure if
