	enterable, etc.

	(yoke): Oops, this wasn't previously takeable!

	* SantaCruz.inf (rainbow):
	It's valid for conversation if we've been to any of its
	found_in places.

	(rain): Don't conceal the rain; just give it an empty describe
	property.  Otherwise, it's not in TAKE ALL.

	(feather): Improve Drop handler's message, and make it a scored task.

	* SF_financial.inf (financial):

	mechanical_museum.ralph_thinks): Add; they all redirect to the same

	(bathroom_referent): Use the new ask_in_scope instead of moved.

	Honor the new ask_in_scope

	conversation), always be in scope without setting MOVED, and a few
	other things.

	purposes.

	(WinningSub): Return false if the mission is still viable.

	(xyzzy): New verb: get the player out of a lost game, if it can be
	done without disrupting the game state.  (In particular, this can't be
	done from the roof, since the helicopter is already in motion.)

	(seen_in_scope): Rename to all_ask_in_scope; all references changed.

	successful attempt to hide Ralph.

	Carla.

	(yoke): Reveal the tires after the take (so don't rely on MOVED to
	describe it).

	(carla): Allow a description to happen for outside the chopper, but no
	actions other than examine.  (Handlers on before and life.)

	the player without the timer starting.

	(ralph): Handle PUSH RALPH UP differently than PUSH RALPH NORTH

	(ralph): Copy the Attack code (which is smart) to Enter (which is

	the guard about the escape hole.
	* SF_financial.inf (pyramid_facade): Fix direction.

	Give him something special to say about the escape hole.

	* Flibnaub.inf ('dry', DrySub):
	New verb.  Defaults to the same message as Rub.

	(turne): New synonym for turn.

	(load, unload): New synonyms.

	people even if they define an ##Attack life routine.  This is
	controlled by can_attack.

	(ralph): Make Insert and PutOn now do their own things, instead of

	suddenly broke.  From what I can tell, the object numbers happened to
	coincide with the property numbers.  That's no longer true, probably
	from the CvsId addition.

	* Sunnyvale.inf (drunks): Add can_attack (for some of Ralph's new code)

	* Flibnaub.inf (MAX_PROP_TABLE_SIZE, MAX_OBJECTS): Increase

	(Street): Fix the code to determine if the player is going to a
	street.  It looks like the old code only worked by coincidence, but

	from the CvsId addition.

	Print the CVS ids in the About menu in debugging mode

	Lots of hint fixups, including a new Alcatraz section
